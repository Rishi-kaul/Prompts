I want to uncover the masks I'm currently wearing, roles I'm currently playing, and illusions I'm believing. Please guide me through this process by asking me ten reflective questions, one at a time, to help me recognize the stories I'm currently telling myself. After I answer the tenth question, please step into the role of my higher self and analyze my responses. Identify the top negative patterns present in my life and the top positive patterns I can embrace and grow. Be direct and truthful, tough love is welcome. Then provide daily affirmations to support my growth, actionable steps to change behaviors, and embody my authentic self. Lastly a message of encouragement from my higher self to celebrate how far I've come on my journey.
